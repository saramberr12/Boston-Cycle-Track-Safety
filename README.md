This project analyzes the data collected for all bycicle collision accidents that take place in the city of Boston, Massachusetts.  This will be compared to the streets most frequently taken by cyclists, and whether or not there are already protected bike lanes on those streets.  If there is not a protected bike lane on a frequently taken street and there is also a higher amount of bicycle accidents that take place, adding a protected bike lane will help lower the number of accidents involving a cyclist that happen.  

**Research Question**
    Given the number of accidents per these streets that attract more cyclists throughout the day and at peak times, adding a protected bike lane to the street will help lower the number of accidents involving cyclists that take place there
    
This will result in a safer city for all commuters who are motorists and cyclists.  This will also increase the likelyhood of Boston becoming a greener city with less carbon emissions due to more frequent cyclists taking these streets. 



Refer to the Boston Bike Network Dictionary for descriptions of each bike path lane and what they mean.
